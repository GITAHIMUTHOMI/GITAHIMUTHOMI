# COVID-19 Data Analysis: Insights & Reporting

A comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, focusing on vaccination progress, infection patterns, and mortality trends across different countries.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data from Our World in Data, with specific focus on:
- **Peak infection analysis** and timing patterns
- **Vaccination rollout performance** across countries
- **Mortality pattern analysis** and anomaly detection
- **Statistical insights** with outlier detection

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```
├── COVID19_Insights_and_Reporting.ipynb    # Main analysis notebook
├── Final Guded project                     # Original Python script
├── owid-covid-data.csv                    # COVID-19 dataset
└── README.md                              # This file
```

## 🔍 Key Insights Generated

1. **Peak Infection Timing**: Analysis of when different countries experienced their highest infection rates
2. **Vaccination Performance**: Country rankings based on vaccination speed and coverage
3. **Mortality Patterns**: Statistical analysis of death rates and anomaly detection
4. **Global Trends**: Comparative analysis across multiple countries
